# Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging via Scalable ScatteringMapping using TOF cameras

This repository contains code for the paper _Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging via Scalable ScatteringMapping using TOF cameras_ by YuJie Fang, JunMing Wu, et al. The captured datasets and the results of network training can be downloaded separately from our [project webpage](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZMXK9iy4z83yjjqJIAd9pw).

## Code Description

The code folder includes model files, training code, and testing software. The testing software is used to view the model's 3D reconstruction results. Our code is written in MATLAB.

This is a schematic of our model.
